<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Park Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Jet Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car park ventilation system market primarily consists of two types of fan technologies: axial fans and jet fans. Axial fans move large volumes of air with low-pressure drops, ideal for general ventilation in open spaces. They are typically mounted in fixed positions. In contrast, jet fans use high-velocity airflow to control smoke and odor, making them suitable for enclosed spaces such as multi-story car parks. Both systems contribute to maintaining air quality and enhancing safety in vehicular environments.</p></p>
