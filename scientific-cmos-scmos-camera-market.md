<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front Illuminated</li><li>Back Illuminated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera market is primarily categorized into two types: Front Illuminated (FI) and Back Illuminated (BI) sensors. Front Illuminated sCMOS sensors capture light through a lens on the front side, resulting in lower sensitivity and higher noise levels but at a reduced cost. In contrast, Back Illuminated sensors offer enhanced sensitivity and lower noise by having a transparent substrate, allowing more light to reach the sensor. This makes BI sCMOS cameras ideal for low-light applications in scientific research.</p></p>
